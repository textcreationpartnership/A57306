            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head type="sub">With Twenty Reaſons why the People of God in Scorn called <hi>Quakers</hi> do Refuſe to hear them.</head>
            <p>GOD Almighty at ſundry times and in divers manners, hath appeared to warn you of his Wrath and ſore diſpleaſure, which hath ſeveral Years hung over your heads; even ready to be revealed from Heaven upon you for your manifold abominations and Oppreſſions, the Cry of which hath reached to Heaven; and therefore hath the God of mercy (who delighteth not in the deſtruction of the wicked) put his word in the Mouthes of his Servants and Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers, who early and late in word and writing, Year after Year, and Time after Time, have exhorted you to ceaſe to do Evil, and learn to do Well and to break off your abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Wickedneſſes and cruel Oppreſſions (under which the Land mournes) by ſpeedy and unfeigned Repentance, but
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:64132:2"/>you have hitherto diſpiſed, evil-intreated and Perſecuted his Meſſengers, and rejected his Word, till even now the wrath of the Lamb is kindled againſt you, from which none can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver you; for you have provoked him (who delighteth in mercy) to wrath and jealouſie dayes without number, your Pride, Covetouſneſs, Drunkenneſs, Whoredoms among you, Lying, Swearing, Oppreſſion, and lording it over God's Heritage, and forcing Thouſands to walk in the broad way to deſtruction with your ſelves (whom you can prevail with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al) is Recorded as with a Pen of Iron, and point of a Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond: Oh! my Heart is Rent becauſe of the miſery and ſore deſtruction which God, will bring upon you &amp; your Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity if you and they ſtill harden your Hearts againſt him, and my wreſtlings are often with the Lord, not to pour forth the vials of his wrath upon your Head, but rather give you peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Hearts, if you have not ſinned out your Day: Oh! that there were ſuch an heart in you as would ſtrip you out of your Phariſaical long Robes, and cloath you with Sackcloth and Aſhes upon your Heads, and cry mightily unto God, as the Men of <hi>Nineveh</hi> did, that God may turn from you his fiery Indignation and ſore diſpleaſure, that is ready to flame in fury againſt you; for your Repentance and not your Deſtruction is the earneſt deſire of my Soul: Oh! that you knew in this your day, the things that belong to your Peace with God, but the Day is very near wherein they will be hid from your Eyes, for God's Spirit will not alwayes ſtrive with you, as it hath hither to done, neither will the place of Repentance be always in your ſight, which when hid, you ſhall ſeek Death and ſhall not find it, and ſhall ſay in the Morning, would God it were Evening, and in the Evening, would God it were Morning, for the dread and horror that ſhall compaſs you on every ſide; then ſhall he that ſits in Heaven laugh at your Calmity, and ſtand far off from you when your fear cometh, even as pain upon a Woman that travaileth, for you have over-paſſed the deeds of the wicked; the Land even ſtinks through your a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominations, you have long fed your ſelves with the Fat of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64132:2"/>this Land, and cloathed your ſelves with the Wool, that you are more like <hi>Sodomites</hi> then Chriſtians, but you have killed, and cruelly Perſecuted thoſe that God hath fed with Bread from Heaven, like the falſe Shepherds of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> whom God by the Mouth of <hi>Ezekiel</hi> cryed wo againſt, <hi>Ezek</hi> 34.2, 3, 4. Oh! what will you do in the end of theſe things, when the God of Righteouſneſs ſhall require his Flock at your Hands? What hath People profitted under you this many Years? Do not both them and yourſelves grow worſe and worſe, you deceiving, and they deceived? but if you had ſtood in the Counſel of God, &amp; had been Authoriz'd by him, &amp; had cauſed People to hear his word of Faith in their Hearts, then had you been as ſo many luſtrous Stars in the Firmament of his power forever, but now you are left as Wells without Water, Clouds carryed about with a Tempeſt; for a little Storm will drive you Eaſt or Weſt, North or South, yea, wandring Stars, to whom (unleſs you ſpeedily Repent) is reſerved the blackneſs of utter Darkneſs forever.</p>
            <p>For the Light of the glorious day of God's power you have wofully hated, and have loved Darkneſs rather, by reaſon of your Evil deeds; and you have ſhut the Kingdom of Heaven againſt many, yea, even all whom you can prevail withall, by hateing, ſlighting, and ſetting at nought the Key of <hi>David,</hi> which ſhould open the Door of entrance unto it, and yet would take it by the force and ſtrength of your earthly Wiſdoms and brain. Knowledge, but this know, that neither Fornicator, nor Adolterer, nor Idolator, nor the unclean hath any part or portion in it, 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 6.9, 10. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.3, 5. but the Darkneſs which they have loved in their life-times ſhall be their lot and portion forever, with the word UTTER annext to it, unleſs they Repent and turn unto the Light with which Chriſt Jeſus hath enlightned them, and love it, and walk in it in your life-times, which hitherto many of you Prieſts have moſt wretchedly deſpiſed and blaſphemed againſt.</p>
            <p>Therefore, oh ye Biſhops and Prieſts, and all your Judges and Officers, whoſe proceedings are corrupted, who have taken the ſheaf from the hungry, and have not bound up the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64132:3"/>broken hearted, nor relieved the OpPreſſed, if ye will not hear nor lay theſe things to Heart, the Lord will ſpread Dung upon your Faces, and will make you a Hiſſing, and a By-word of of Reproach to Generations to come, for your Iniquities are almoſt full, and you are daily heaping up Wrath againſt the Day of wrath, they who work Wickedneſs are ſet up and Countenanced among you, and they that tempt God every day are even delivered, and counted your great Church-Members, and Communicants; but they who reprove Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the Gate, are grievouſly drawn before your Judgment Seats, and made a Prey upon, both in their Perſons and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, which was never Chriſt's, but Antichriſt's way of Convincing gain ſayers.</p>
            <p>And how do you lead many blind to Deſtruction, by forcing them under the penalty of Excommunication to eat and drink their own damnation; if it be matter of Damnation to eat at your table without Faith in it, how many have you drawn before your Judgment Seats, becauſe they come not to your Sacrament, are you certain they have examin'd themſelves according to the Apoſtle's command, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.28. or do you know them to be worthy, or diſcern the Lord's Body? or do you diſcern it your ſelves, without which, <hi>whoſoever eateth or drinketh, doth it unworthily to his own damnation, verſ.</hi> 29. And how can you ever ſtand clear before the Seat of divine Juſtice, who force men under ſevere Penalties, contrary to the perſwaſion of their own Hearts after Examination (by which many have found their unworthineſs) to eat and drink their own Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or elſe they muſt be curſed out of your worſhipping Houſes, and caſt out of the Society and company of their Friends and loving Neighbours? Oh! the Cry of theſe things is loud, was this ever Chriſt or the Apoſtles way and manner towards them who oppoſed them? did not Chriſt command his to bleſs their very Perſecutors? And did not the Apoſtle forbid the Saints to Curſe? <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.14. And did not the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>James</hi> ſay, that <hi>out of one Mouth ſhould not come bleſſing and curſſing? James</hi> 3.10. And was ever any forbidden to buy or ſell, or have Society amongſt men, but only by the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64132:3"/>Power of the Beaſt ſpoken of by <hi>John, Revelation</hi> 13.16, 17. who made War with the Lamb and the Saints; now let the wiſe Judge who is your example in your Court-proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, whether Chriſt or Antichriſt according to your profeſſed Rule, <hi>viz.</hi> the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>And if you prevail upon any, who through Fear of your Whip do outwardly conform to your Worſhip, contrary to the Perſwaſions of their own Hearts; do not you thereby make them Hypocrites, and twofold more the Children of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil then before? God hath turned the Hearts of many from you, and hath commanded them to offer a Sacrifice to him out of the Borders of <hi>Egypt,</hi> even in the Wilderneſs, which is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Red Sea, in the Way to the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and your Purſuit of them here, will be to your own overthrow, as it was <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s. Oh conſider what you are a doing by your Courts and Proceedings; is it not to draw them into <hi>Egypt</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, whom God by the Cords of his infinite Love hath drawn into the Land of <hi>Goſhen,</hi> where they enjoy and poſſeſs Light in their Dwellings, and have forever turned their Backs of <hi>Egypt</hi>'s Land, having ſet their Faces <hi>Zion-ward,</hi> and are come to the Father's Houſe (i e.) <hi>The true Light</hi>) where they have Bread enough, yea, of the living Bread which is come down from Heaven, by which they are nouriſhed up to Eternal Life, ſo that your Husk they utterly refuſe, which you ſell at a coſtly Rate, with which no weary Soul can ever be, nor never was ſatisfied.</p>
            <p>Therefore touch them not I charge you by the God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, nor offend the leaſt among them; for they are near and dear unto the Lord, and he tenders them as the Apple of his Eye; and no Weapon formed againſt them ſhall ever proſper; are you ſtill ſo blind, as not to conſider your ill Succeſs in this Undertaking this many Years? methinks you ſhould have as much Wiſdom as <hi>Gamaliel</hi> had, to ſay, <hi>Let them alone, if they be of God they will ſtand, if not, he will overthrow them, leſt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily you be found Fighters againſt God,</hi> Acts 5.34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39. And you ſhould conſider the Parable of the Wheat and Tares, how that the Lord of the Houſhold of Faith would not ſuffer his Servants to pluck up the Tares, but commanded that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64132:4"/>they ſhould grow among the Wheat to the End of the world, though he declared them to be the Children of the wicked one, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.18. to the 44th verſe. He was not of your Mind, to root them out from the Earth, though he infallibly knew them to be ſown by the Enemy, which you do not pretend unto, and therefore cannot diſcern between the Children of God and the Chidren of the Devil, but call Good Evil, and Evil Good; and put Light for Darkneſs, and Darkneſs for Light, as your Fore-Fathers did in the Dayes of old; But if you fall upon that Rock you have ſo long ſtembled at, you will be broken; but upon whomſoever it falls, it will grind him to Powder: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore dread the Majeſty of the great God of Heaven, at whoſe Rebuke all the Mountains of the Earth tremble and are moved; and howl all ye idle Vine-dreſſers, whoſe Vineyards are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grown with Weeds; the Lord of the Vineyard is come to look for Fruit, and behold<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there is little among you, but bitter, four and ill-taſted Fruits, your Vine is the Vine of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and your Grapes the Grapes of <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> and the Lord of the Vineyard will caſt you out as unprofitable Servants, and idle Shepherds, unleſs you weed out all the Bryars and Thorns, and then, which of you can eſcape; for the beſt among you, who are guilty of Perſecution, are as a Bryar, and ſharper then a Thorn-Hedge, from which no pleaſant Grapes can be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſo that by your Fruits you are known, and not by your Words, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.2, 3. for you have got the good Words &amp; the fair Speeches, by which you deceive the Hearts of the ſimple; and if Covetouſneſs be Idolatry which none queſtions, then, who are greater Idolaters then your ſelves? of whoſe covetous Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices the whole Nation is full, having a Cloud of Witneſſes in every pariſh. And how can you call your ſelves ſpiritual Perſons, when you ſo much reſiſt the Spirit of Truth, and contemn thoſe who own and witneſs it to be their Guide and Leader into all Truth? for none can truly be ſpiritual Perſons, but who by the ſpirit of Truth are made ſo; for all men naturally are carnal, ſold under Sin; and none can judge for God, but they who are led by his Spirit.</p>
            <p>Now if you were led by the Spirit of God, you would let
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:64132:4"/>People alone to be perſwaded by it, in things relating to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther world, whoſe Fruits have no bad Aſpect on the affairs of this, and eſpecially they who deſire nothing more then to live a quiet and peaceable Life, in all Godlineſs and Honeſty; but by oppreſſing ſuch, you not only ſeek the Deſtruction of their Souls, but of their Bodies alſo; and if ſuch be not ravening wolves there was never any in the world.</p>
            <p>And as your Fore Fathers did, ſo do ye begin at the wrong End, inſtead of being a Terror to Evil doers, you make your ſelves ſuch to them that do well, and let Drunkards, Lyars, Swearers, Whoremongers and Adulterers go free, which God will judge, and becauſe of theſe and many mroe Abominations the Land now mourns; and there is but a ſmall Remnant that fighs and mourns for all the Abominations that are committed therein; but the great Number lives wantonly upon the Earth, and kill the juſt one, and cruifie afreſh the Lord of Glory, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him to open Shame, and give Occaſion to the Adulterers of Forreign Nations to blaſpheme the Name of the God of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> which he will require at your Hands.</p>
            <p>And why do you ſuffer Forreign and other Cheats to come in and ſet up Stage-playes in open Streets of Cities and Towns, whereby the Name of God is dreadfully blaſphemed, &amp; youth and old ge wofully corrupted and debauched. Oh! what will you do? or where will you appear when God ariſeth to take Vengeance for theſe things? My Soul is even bowed down at the Conſideration of theſe things, and often mourns in ſecret for the Abomination of Deſolation, which now ſtands where it ought not, therefore let him that reads underſtand.</p>
            <p>And Nation is now appearing againſt Nation &amp; Kingdom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Kingdom, &amp; Famins, Peſtilences &amp; terrible Earth quakes in divers places, yea, many Signs in Heaven, and Wonders in the Earth-beneath, of the breaking forth of the wrath of the Lamb, whoſe Patience and Long-ſuffering being ſleighted, you are not led to Repentance; but they wax worſe and worſe, deceiving and being deceived; even heaping up Wrath againſt the day of Wrath, and the revealing of the righteous Judgment of God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:64132:5"/>
Even as it was in the Dayes of <hi>Noah,</hi> ſo is it now in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Son of Man; for the Earth is filled with Violence, and is corrupted by Iniquity, and the dark Corners thereof are full of the Habitations of Cruelty, but an Ark is prepared, and a ſmall Remnant are gathered, and more gathering daily into it, at the Command of the Lord; the like Figure, whereunto Baptiſm now ſaveth us, not the putting away of the Filth of the Fleſh, but the anſwer of a good Conſcience, by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of Jeſus; and now it is fulfilled, that as <hi>Moſes</hi> lifted up the Serpent in the Wilderneſs, ſo is the Son of Man lifted up in the Hearts of his People in this his Day, of whoſe Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment there ſhall be no End; and all are and will be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted his Enemies, that will not ſuffer him thus to reign.</p>
            <p>But he gives <hi>Caeſar</hi> his due at this Day <hi>(viz.)</hi> the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in outward things; for his Kingdom is not of this world, neither do his Servants fight, but are made perfect through Suffering, as their Lord and Maſter was in the Dayes of old.</p>
            <p>Therefore awake, awake all you who have long laid in Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; for the great and notable Day of the Lord is dawning, wherein all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly ſhall be as Stubble and the Day that cometh ſhall leave them neither root not branch; but unto them who fear the Name of the Lord, and depart from Iniquity, and hate every evil way, ſhall the Sun of Righteouſneſs ariſe with Healing, and ſhall give them Beauty for Aſhes, and the Oyl of Joy for the Spirit of Heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, under which they have walked many Years; and the Cup of Trembling ſhall be taken out of their Hand, and ſhall be given into the Hands of them who oppreſs them.</p>
            <p>And God's Arm is not ſhortned that it cannot ſave, neither is his Ear heavy that it cannot hear the cry of the Poor, and complaint of the Needy, who are even at this day groaning under the burthens of an oppreſſed Conſcience, through the cruel unnatural impoſitions of men, having aſſumed that to themſelves, which is proper and peculiar to God alone, <hi>(viz.)</hi> The Government in ſpiritual matters relating to another world, this is his honour which he will not give to another, and if all Judgment be committed to the Son, what place is
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:64132:5"/>left for the Biſhops Judges? What Judgment is to them committed? And who gave them Authority to ſet Judges over mens Conſciences in matters of Faith and Worſhip? do not the Scriptures ſay, that <hi>Whatſoever is not of Faith is Sin?</hi> Rom. 14.23. <hi>And without Faith 'tis impoſſible to pleaſe God, Heb.</hi> 11.6. Now do not you greatly diſhonour the Son, who is the only Author and Giver of Faith, who would impoſe a Worſhip contrary thereunto, upon his Servants? is not he only ſpiritual Judge of Heaven and Earth, whoſe Judgment is juſt, and according to Truth and Righteouſneſs altogether? &amp; how can you judge of ſpiritual Things, if you have not the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Spirit, and ſo not ſure of your own ſtanding, nor of the way you walk in to be Right; and yet Perſecute others even to Life, Liberty and Eſtate, becauſe they will not walk in your uncertain way? you preſume higher then did the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> of old, (though ſhort of their Righteouſneſs) for they were ſaid but to ſit in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Seat, who had a Legal miniſtration; but you pretend to ſit in Chriſt's Seat, who hath an everlaſting Spiritual Prieſthood, and is only Judge of quick and dead: Therefore down with your pretended ſpiritual Courts whereby you would limit God in his Worſhip, and preſcribe his Servants a way, which your ſelves do not certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know to be true, to worſhip God contrary to the meaſure of Faith they have received from God, and let ſound honeſt Judges in Temporal matters between a Man &amp; his Neighbour be ſet up in all Caſes of difference in temporal things, and let them be a terror to Evil-doers under what Name and Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſoever; for the Law was made for ſuch, and not for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men, have you any preſident in the Scriptures, in all the dayes of the Miniſtration of <hi>Moſes,</hi> in the dayes of <hi>Abraham,</hi> in the time of the Prophets, or in any of the Goſpel-diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that ever any outward Law with an outward penalty, was made againſt them, who did not Worſhip God in that way &amp; manner, in which he had appeared in thoſe dayes? If you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, you muſt either judge them deficient who had the miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Offices in thoſe diſpenſations, or your ſelves to take more upon you, then you have either precept or example for in the holy Scriptures.</p>

            <head>Here followeth ſome of the weighty Reaſons why we who are called <hi>Quakers,</hi> do deny the Biſhops and their Prieſts to be Miniſters of the Goſpel, and do refuſe to hear them.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. YOU being made Miniſters by the Will and Wiſdom of Man, and what you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived being from man, and taught you by man, and not by the Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt, contrary to the true Miniſters in the Dayes of old, having not entred in at the Door, but climbed up ſome other way, therefore we cannot own you to be ordained of God, nor to be true Shepherds.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. After this wrong Beginning you have been induct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by men into great Benefices, in every Place, as you could obtain them; and have preached for Hire, and have ſpoken a Divination of your own Brain-ſtudy in your carnal Wiſdoms, and not from the Mouth of the Lord, as he hath taught you, and therefore have you remained, ſome Ten, ſome Twenty Years, more or leſs, in a fat Benefice, and have not profited the People at all, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.21, 22.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. You like the falſe Prophets of <hi>Iſrael</hi> have every one ſought your own Way, every one for his Gain from his Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>Iſe</hi> 56.10, 11. And moreover, have run from Quarter to Quarter where was moſt Gain, and ſo have made Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize of People through Covetouſneſs, as they did whom <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> teſtified againſt, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1, 2, 3. This hath manifeſted to us and all ſober People, that you have the Spirit of Error.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 4. You have run and the Lord hath not ſent you, therefore have you turned none to Righteouſneſs, nor profited
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:64132:6"/>the People at all; but if you had ſtood in the Counſel of God, and had cauſed People to hear his Word, which is Chriſt, then you ſhould have turned them from the Evil of their Wayes, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 5. You have fed your ſelves with the Fat, and cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed your ſelves with the Wooll, and like Drones have lain within, and have eaten up that which many have laboured hard for, and have perſecuted and killed them, who are fed by Chriſt the true Shepherd; therefore is the Hand of the Lord turned againſt you, and he will wipe you as a man wipeth a Diſh, turning it upſide down.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 6. You have born Rule by your Means, and have been called Lords and Maſters, and them who could not give you thoſe flattering Titles, you have hated and perſecuted; and you have loved and ſtrove for the chiefeſt Places in the Aſſemblies, and the uppermoſt Rooms at Feaſts, and have gone in long Robes; and for a Pretence have made long Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, being directly ſuch as Chriſt cryed Wo againſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 7. You have come to People in Sheeps Cloathing, and through your Good VVords and Fair Sperches have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Hearts of the Simple, but inwardly are Ravening Wolves; you are known to the whole Nation by your Fruits being written in great Characters upon your Foreheads <hi>(viz.)</hi> Pride, Covetouſneſs, Luxury, Drunkenneſs, Whoredom, Lying, Swearing, the Abominations of the Heathen, and therefore are Evil Trees, which have no Promiſe, but to be hewen down.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 8. You have cried Peace to every one that would put into your Mouths and feed you with Tythes, Gifts and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, but they who have denied you theſe, you, like ravening Wolves, have devoured many Widows Houſes, and tender Lambs; and have far exceeded (in making Spoil of Peoples
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:64132:7"/>Goods who have received nothing from you) all the falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets that ever I heard or read of, either in the Scriptures, or any Hiſtory ſince the Foundation of the World; and therefore we cannot own you as true Shepherds, but as ravening Wolves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 9. You have not been content with Chriſt's Wages to his Miniſters (viz.) <hi>into whatſoever Houſe ye enter, eat and drink ſuch things as they ſet before you; for the Labourer is worthy of his Meat,</hi> Luke 10. therefore never truly ſent forth by him, but have gone in the Way of <hi>Cain,</hi> and after the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of <hi>Balaam, Jude</hi> 11. who erred from the Spirit of God, and then was more blind then the Aſs he rode on.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 10. You have followed your own Spirits, and have mocked and derided thoſe that poſſeſs the infallible Spirit of Truth, and therefore are Miniſters of the Letter which killeth, and not of the Spirit which giveth Life; for the leaſt Meaſure of the Spirit of Truth is infallible, and never deceived any who were guided by it, but the whole Body of the Spirit of Error is fallible, and worketh with all Deceivableneſs of Unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, its Fruits being ſuch as are mentioned in the nine fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Reaſons why the <hi>Quakers</hi> deny the Prieſthood of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 11. You, when you have ſeen the Wolf come, have fled, and left your Flocks to be devoured by him, when the Arm of Fleſh turned againſt you; and therefore are you mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt Hirelings, and not of the true Shepherd, who laid down his Life for his Flock, <hi>John</hi> 10.12, 13.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 12. You have not turned People from Darkneſs to the true Light, wherewith Chriſt Jeſus hath enlightned every man that cometh into the World, <hi>John</hi> 1.9. nor from the Power of Satan to the Power of God, whereby they might witneſs Remiſſion of Sins, contrary to the Doctrine and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of Chriſt and the true Miniſters of the Goſpel, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.16, 17, 18. but you have kept people in Darkneſs, and under
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:64132:7"/>the power of Satan; and have preached and made people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve they muſt remain under Satan's power all the Dayes of their Lives, and conſequently have made the Death, Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Blood of Chriſt of none Effect, and the Second Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of no more Force nor Virtue then the Firſt, nor the Blood of Chriſt no better then the Blood of Bulls and Goats, which could not cleanſe from Sin; and therefore you and they dye in your Sins as Chriſt ſaid to the <hi>Jews, John</hi> 8.21.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 13. You creep into the Idolatrous Houſes which were built by the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and conſecrated to Idolatry, and there lead ſilly men and women captive, laden with Sin and divers Luſts, ever learning, and never able to come to the Knowledge of the Truth, which is Chriſt the Light of the World, and ſo Freedom from Sin, and Eternal Life in Chriſt is hid from your Eyes, and the Way of Peace neither the Leaders, nor they who are led know; and therefore we call you blind Leaders of the blind, as Chriſt did thoſe who walked in your Steps, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.14.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 14. You have a ſhew of <hi>Godlineſs,</hi> but deny, hate and perſecute the <hi>Power of Godlineſs</hi> in all, in whom it is brought forth; and for this Reaſon alſo we turn away from you, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Apoſtle's Doctrine, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 15. You are Wells without Water, Clouds carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with a Tempeſt; for when the Storm came and beat upon your Houſes, which you upon the Sand had built, they fell, and you fled at their Fall, and great was their Fall; ſo you are Hearers and not Doers, deceiving your own Souls, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.26, 27.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 16. You dip or ſprinkle Infants, and cauſe men and women to promiſe and vow, that they ſhall forſake the Devil and all his works, the pomps and vanities of this world, and all the ſinful Luſts of the Fleſh, which you nor they can never perform; here you are grievous Covenant-Breakers; for nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:64132:8"/>you nor they in that ſtate you ſtand in, can keep God's Holy Will, nor his Commandments, one Day in all your Lives; and ſo lay heavy Burdens upon others, which you will not touch with one of your Fingers, and cauſe many to break their ſolemn Covenant with God, which will be charged to you in the Day of Account; and ſo are the Covenant-Breakers ſpoken of, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.3.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 17. You deny Perfection, and Freedom from Sin in this Life, contrary to the Doctrine of Chriſt and his Miniſters, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.48. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.15. 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.17. and ſo make void the Gifts given by Chriſt at his Aſcenſion, which were for the perfecting of the Saints, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.12.13.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 18. You have kept people in Doubt of their Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in telling them they muſt have a Body of Sin as long as they live, and not reſolving them where this Body of ſin muſt be done away, ſeeing the Scripture ſaith, <hi>There is no Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of God in Death, and in the Grave who ſhall give him Thanks,</hi> Pſal. 6.5. And again <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Grave cannot praiſe the Lord, nor Death celebrate him, and they that go down to the Pit cannot hope for his Truth,</hi> Iſaiah 38.18. So unleſs you tell People where or when they ſhall be made free from Sin, and prove the ſame by plain Scripture, you will be ſeen of all to be manifeſt Deceivers, ſeeing no Unclean Thing ſhall enter into the Kingdom of Righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 19. You deny Immediate Revelation, and Inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the Spirit of God at this day, through which the things of God's Kingdom both is and ever was known, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.29. <hi>Job.</hi> 32.8. <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.17. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. &amp; 27. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.10, 11. And thereby do keep People from the knowledge of God and Jeſus Chriſt, whom he hath ſent, whom to know is Life eternal, <hi>John</hi> 17.3. this again ſhews you (in Doctrine) to be contrary to the Apoſtles and Primitive Chriſtians, who were Sons and Daughters of God, and led by the Spirit of God,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:64132:8"/>
               <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.14. So for this Reaſon alſo we deny you, and turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from you, as being Miniſters of the Letter that killeth, and not of the Spirit that giveth Life, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 20. You love to be called <hi>Lord-Biſhops,</hi> and your Prieſts <hi>Maſter</hi> ſuch a one, and <hi>Maſter</hi> ſuch a one contrary to the Scriptures and the Titles of the Holy men of God therein recorded; for we do not read of <hi>Lord Timothy,</hi> nor <hi>Lord Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> though Biſhops; nor of <hi>Maſter Paul,</hi> nor <hi>Maſter Peter,</hi> &amp;c. This again ſhews you to be more like the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who exerciſed Lordſhip over their Brethren, then Miniſters of Chriſt; but Chriſt ſaid, it ſhould not be ſo among his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, but <hi>He that would be greateſt ſhould be Servant to all,</hi> Mark 10.43.</p>
